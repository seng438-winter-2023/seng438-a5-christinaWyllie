# Introduction
The purpose of this lab is to learn about software reliability and the tools available to measure the reliabilty of a system. The team will be comparing reliability growth testing to reliabilty demonstration chart testing, explaining how each system works and how they are similar to different to each other. 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
The team decided to use the C-SFRAT program and convert the data2 to an xls file to be able to analyze it. 

The original data imported can be seen here:

The failure rate does not decrease as time goes on. The patterns remain consistent. 

The graph generated data with the C and F covariate.

As a group we then analyzed the best fit for the graph by examining log-likelihood. The higher that value is the more accurate the model. The 2 models chosen were the geometric and the discrete weibull type. Both of these has a log likihood around -113.

Analyzing the failure intesity graph we can observe that the failure rate remains consistent. This demonstrates that the data set does not have strong reliability growth.

Additionally, after reviewing the MVF graph. We used the prediction tool to predict to 99 intervals.

This shows that the amount of new failures has decreased since the original data. This represents an increase in reliability because the system is slowly approaching a plateau. 
## Laplace Graph and Finding the Ideal Range
![alt text](ReportMedia/LaplaceEquation.png)
We used the above equation to calculate the laplace of each data point we had from report 2.

We calculated the values in excel and plotted it in excel. Given these laplace values it was determined that the the best range would be the one with the most decline because that is where there is the most reliability growth. Ideally, this range would be 1-11 however given that there are very few data points the team then decided on using 1-24 as an acceptable range. 

## A Discussion on Decision Making Given a Target Failure Rate
![alt text](media/FailureIntesityPrediction.png)
The target failure rate the group has chosen is .3. We came to this conclusion by testing other target failure rates and seeing how the decline changes. Though this means that far more testing needs to occur, with the data given it is impossible to have a greater target. Additionally, when calculating the MTTF on the laplace graph the value given was .35. This is consistent to the failure intensity target.  

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

## Reliability Demonstration Chart
![alt text](ReportMedia/RDC.png)
We found an minMTTF of 424 by checking when our observed number of failures graph began to enter the acceptable region. We first generated a graph with the majority of the observed failures in the acceptable region and from there we increased our MTTF until our observed number of failures began to enter the the accepatble region. 

## Twice MTTF
![alt text](ReportMedia/TwiceRDC.png)
To generate the twice MTTF graph we mutiplied our number of input events by 2 to get a maximum number of acceptable failures per number of input events of $\frac{3}{2544}$ giving us an MTTF of 848. 


## Half MTTF
![alt text](ReportMedia/HalfRDC.png)
To generate the half MTTF Graph we multiplied our original number of input events by 0.5 to get a maximum number of input events of $\frac{3}{636}$ giving us an MTTF of 212.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of RDC

# Comparison of Results


# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques
Reliability Growth Testing and Reliability Demo Chart Testing are both methods used to graph, interpret, and analyze failure data of a system. The RGT method involves calculating reliability trends to determine failure intensity of the system under test, whereas the RDC method uses risk factors to inform whether a system should be rejected or accepted. With the RGT method, we can calculate a quantitative value for the reliability of a system, but the RDC method only indicates whether a system is acceptable or not under the given parameters. However RDC is more useful when failure data is limited because the accuracy of the RGT method depends on the sample size. 

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
In this lab, Christina worked with the instructors to figure out how the run the reliability software and format the datasets. Sobia and Maitry used the given data to create the reliability growth testing graphs, and calculate the Laplace factor using this data. Sobia also used the test data to create the RDC graphs.  

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
This lab was incredibly challenging. Both the understanding the content and excuting the lab was a frustrating experience. It took a long time for the entire group to understand what the datasets actually mean and how they can be displayed in the program. It was hard to figure out what an RDC is and how to use it in additon to understanding what reliability growth testing actually means.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
Please confirm that the datasets can work with the given program. More time was spent figuring out the formatting of the dataset to work with the program rather than actually learning and understanding the content of the lab. TA's should run datasets on their laptops and confirm which files work and how they work with the program so that they are better prepared to deal with the students problems during the lab period.
